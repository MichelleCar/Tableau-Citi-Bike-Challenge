![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/115101031/224523484-c6ea3ce2-7ad7-4e0b-a21b-fafa99a3a802.jpeg)

## Background 
Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Deployment
Please find below the link to the Tableau dashboard, showcasing the results of the analysis: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeremy.tallant/viz/citibike_16762569400730/Story1
    
## Data Source
1. The initial stage of the project involved acquiring all the monthly CSV files, covering the period from January 2018 to December 2020, from the [Citi Bike Data](https://citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage and organizing them in a designated folder named "data". The data used in this analysis specifically pertains to the Jersey City region.
2. Subsequently, I established a Jupyter Notebook file, named "[citibike.ipynb](https://github.com/JeremyTallant/tableau-challenge/blob/main/citibike.ipynb)", to systematically clean and combine all the monthly CSV files into a single CSV file, in preparation for importing into Tableau.
3. The following is a comprehensive overview of the data cleansing process:
   * First import pandas.

   * Read in all csv files for a single year in a pandas dataframe, store in a list, and then concatenate into a single dataframe.

   **Please note that the large size of the CSV files precludes their storage in this repository and in GitHub's Large File Storage. As a result, the CSV files have been added to a .gitignore file.**

## Methodology
My task, as the data analyst, is to build a set of data reports to address their questions about the program.  In looking for an effective avenue of inquiry, I used 4 data sets: January and February for 2022 and 2023.

Questions I am hoping to answer for city officials:
1) Is there a discernable pattern of use of the program over a similar time period from 2022 to 2023?
2) How can certain patterns of use inform city officials on ways to improve the program.

## Dashboards
Looking at the most recent data available (January and February 2023), I wondered if meangingful analysis and conclusions could be drawn by  comparing it to the 2022 data sets for the same two months.  For example:
1) Total ridership (bar chart)
2) Ridership by weekeday (treemap)
3) Ridership  by time of day (heat map)
4) Bike preference by users (pie chart)
5) Comparison of trip duration between Citi Bike members versus casual users (customised shape chart)
6) Trips by bike type (bubble chart)
7) Average trip duration by bike type (bar chart)
8) Top 10 start and end stations (scaled bar chart)
9) Geolocation of top 50 start and end stations (map, with toggles for year)
10) Average trip duration for the top 50 start and end stations (map, with toggles for year)

* An evaluation of the data covering the time period from 2018 to 2020 shows a total of 1,095,641 trips made using bicycles in New York City. This represents a decrease of 4.83% over the three-year period. The observed decline in trips can be attributed to the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the associated shutdowns, on the usage of bicycles.
* A comparison of the data from 2018 to 2020 reveals a decrease of 30.20% in the number of subscribers, while there was a simultaneous increase of 374.90% in the number of customers. This disparity in trends can be attributed to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the usage of bicycles in New York City.
* Over the specified time period, there appears to be a positive trend in the number of female riders, with an increase of 12.55%, while the number of male riders has decreased by 22.29%. While the reason for this trend is not definitively known, it could potentially be attributed to improved safety and security measures for female riders. Further analysis would be required to establish this hypothesis.
